            We love your faces and made this shirt design with all of you in mind. It looks great, but most of the
            emotes, memes, and inside jokes are for our dedicated watchers &lt;3. We hope you appreciate it and consider
            purchasing one!
          </p>
          <p>The campaign runs for 3 weeks total <a href="//teespring.com/twitch/bt-chat-memes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
          <p>
            If we sell at least 50 shirts in 3 weeks, we'll be able to run a second campaign :-) Thanks for your
            continued support, and we hope you'll check out the shirt at least!
